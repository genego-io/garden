# My digital garden (DG)

This repository holds the code for my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). A online expos√© of my
ideas, thoughts, skills, interests and everything else I don't deem to be private knowledge and information. Currently
its a work in process (WIP), but should soon be online and available. This repository marks my freedom from third party
applications like Gitbook, Gatsby Cloud, LinkedIn and Wordpress. With this DG I will bring it all together.
